## Requirements

Prisma requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

- [Node.js 8.2.0](https://nodejs.org) and NPM 5.2.0 or newer

> To install the current stable version of Node, click the "Recommended for Most Users" button to begin the download. When that completes, double-click the **.pkg** installer to begin installation.

## Usage

Prisma runs any time you open a local project, automatically lints all open files, then reports errors and warnings in Nova's **Issues** sidebar and the editor gutter:

Prisma intelligently suggests completions for you as you write:

Prisma displays relevant documentation when you hover over symbols:

Prisma can automatically format your schemas on-save if you want,
this can be turned on in **Configuration**.
You can manually format prisma documents with the **Format Schema** command
when a schema is open.

### Configuration

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select Prisma's **Preferences** tab.

<!-- You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project â†’ Project Settings...** -->
